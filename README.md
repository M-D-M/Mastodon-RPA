# Mastodon-RPA
Automation for Mastodon Servers, primarily focused on automatic moderation.

# Purpose
The purpose behind this project is to create a system to automatically respond to two main types of abuse vectors in Mastodon:
- Abuse from new Mastodon instances that have been quickly created to avoid existing domain blocks
- Abuse from new users of very large Mastodon instances, where, because of the instance's size, moderation may be lacking or not as quick to respond, compared to a smaller server.
